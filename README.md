Perceptron learning

In this project, single-layer networks will discriminate 2 classes of 5 Ã— 4 characters (one class at a time). 
One prototype of each class will be given to build a training set. 
Then test sets with increasing levels of noise will be used in testing the trained networks. 
Hebbian, Perceptron, and Adaline learning will be used for training weights in the single-layer network.
